            Cozy up with a hot mug of hot chocolate this winter. This hot chocolate recipe is incredibly rich, creamy, and oh-so satisfying.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: This sweet and creamy hot cocoa starts with white sugar and unsweetened cocoa powder.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the chocolatey flavor, but it won't make your hot cocoa taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Water</strong>: Pour boiling water over the sugar, cocoa powder, and salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong>: You can use whole, 2 percent, or the alternative milk of your choice.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: A dash of vanilla takes the decadent flavor over the top.</li>
            <li><strong>Half-and-half</strong>: Half-and-half is added after the hot chocolate is poured into the mugs, creating a rich texture and cooling the cocoa to a drinkable temperature.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Combine sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a saucepan. Add boiling water and whisk until smooth. Bring mixture to a simmer, stirring continuously to prevent scorching, and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
           <li>Stir in milk and heat until very hot without boiling.</li>
           <li>Remove from heat; add vanilla.</li>
           <li>Add cream to each mug to help cool cocoa to drinking temperature then divide hot cocoa between 4 mugs.</li>
           <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
